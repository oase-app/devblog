## Logo, font and colors {{ date: '2023-04-19T00:00Z' }}

[Katinka Bukh](https://katbukh.com/) has helped us create this wonderful logo, and find our font, [Gimlet Sans](https://djr.com/font-of-the-month-club#2022-09). Both are inspired by the superellipse which we find to be a very interesting shape.

We're really excited about it, and believes that our core values (which Katinka also helped us identify), is really well represented in the identity.

## Projections: How we keep the client updated {{ date: '2023-03-09T00:00Z' }}

I'm getting really happy with the abstractions for keeping the client up to date with new data.

I call them projections. On the server, a projection has a `schema`, a `processor` and a `channel`.

The `schema` knows what is persisted about the projection in the database. The `processor` knows how to populate the database from the domain events, and broadcasts messages to clients when appropriate. The `channel` handles the connection to clients, including authorization and DTOs.

It's now really ease to use in the client:

```javascript
const [oase] = useProjection(`feel:oase:${oaseId}`);
```

Now just use `oase`, and trust it will be updated real-time whenever something happens.

## Phoenix Frameword: The real time dream {{ date: '2023-03-08T00:00Z' }}

Using Phoenix Frameword is really nice. The abstractions around Web Sockets is really is, and it just works.

I've included their Javascript library in the app, and that's basically it. Sockets and channels will reconnect when needed, and I don't have to worry about keeping the connection to the server alive.

## Initial commit {{ date: '2023-03-07T00:00Z' }}

And we're off. The dream is to build _the go-to platform for communities_.

Our (naive) plan is to create a product of high quality, and then let the network effect distribute it.
